# What's Good
I'm revisiting my [When In Rome](https://github.com/bednar85/when-in-rome) which is a React based web app that sorts and filters a curated version of Yelp data (cafes, restaurants, ice cream shops, and historical landmarks). 

This version is using mock JSON I formed based on a coffee shop search in Fishtown, Philadelphia using Yelp.

## Technologies
It's currently using the following technologies:
- Webpack + Babel + ES6
- Reactjs
- Redux
- Ant Design UI Component Library
