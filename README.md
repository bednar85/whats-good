# What's Good

This is my latest iteration of [When In Rome](https://github.com/bednar85/when-in-rome) a React app I created for sorting and filtering a curated set of data (cafes, restaurants, ice cream shops, and historical landmarks).

In this version, I integrated the Yelp API and make requests for data using on a search term input by the user and the user's geolocation.

## Technologies
